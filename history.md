Mike's is a family owned restaurant that was founded way back in 1972 when life was simpler. It was founded by Tom Zindros before it was taken over by brothers Michael and George Mouzas.

Mike and George are from a small village in Greece. They moved to the United States to achieve the American Dream and run their own small business. Mike and George ran the Pizza Palace for decades never changing the recipe to our pizza or our grinders. If you taste our food you can be sure that that's what it tasted like in 1972.

Mike has since retired but George continues to run the business with his wife and two children. We like keep things simple around here so you can expect that Naugatuck's neighborhood pizza shop will never change as the years go by!
